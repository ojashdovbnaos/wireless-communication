# Wireless Multipath Channel Modeling

## Overview
Accurate modeling of **wireless multipath fading channels** is critical for designing and evaluating modern communication systems. This project studies the **Sum-of-Sinusoids (SOS)** channel modeling approach under the **COST207 rural four-path scenario**.

## Methods Evaluated
Three different parameter-computation methods for SOS modeling are implemented and compared.

## Analysis
The performance of each method is assessed using:
- **Time-domain impulse responses**  
- **Doppler power spectral density estimates**  
- **Bit-error-rate (BER) simulations**  

## Goal
To understand the strengths and limitations of each SOS parameter computation method in realistic multipath fading environments.
